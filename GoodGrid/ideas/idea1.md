Below is a cohesive package centered on your chosen brand name, **Good Grid**:

1) Refined brand narrative for Good Grid  
2) Slide deck outline with Good Grid–specific headlines  
3) A full, coding-ready PRD for a React Native + Expo multi-sided marketplace (customers, shoppers, merchants), aligned with best practices and multi-vendor patterns used in Expo-based apps [1][2][3].

## 1. Brand Narrative: Good Grid

### Brand Name & Tagline

- **Name:** Good Grid  
- **Tagline:** “A smarter grid for good food, fair work, and healthier lives.”

### One-Sentence Positioning

Good Grid is a health-first grocery delivery platform that connects customers, shoppers, and local markets on a fair, transparent “grid” where everyone benefits—better food for customers, better pay for workers, and better tools for local vendors.

### Expanded Brand Narrative

The modern food system runs on invisible grids—supply chains, data networks, gig platforms. But those grids aren’t always good for the people inside them. Shoppers race against opaque algorithms. Customers scroll through endless options with little real help eating better. Local farms and small markets struggle to compete with corporate giants and generic delivery apps.

**Good Grid** is a new kind of grocery grid—designed intentionally to be good.

On the customer side, Good Grid turns grocery shopping into a guided, health-aware experience. Instead of just listing products, the app highlights nutrition, suggests healthier swaps, and showcases local producers. Customers can filter by health goals and dietary needs, and see exactly where their money goes.

On the shopper side, Good Grid treats delivery as skilled, professional work. Shoppers see transparent pay formulas for every batch, including base pay, distance/time, and tips. They get intelligent tools for routing and in-store picking, not just pressure to go faster. A share of subscription and analytics revenue is explicitly dedicated to raising shopper earnings.

On the merchant side, Good Grid offers local grocers, farms, and specialty shops a modern, multi-vendor marketplace presence without forcing them into predatory economics. They maintain their brand identity in-app, manage their catalog and inventory, and receive anonymized demand insights that help them stock what their community actually needs.

Under the hood, Good Grid aggregates and anonymizes order data to power insights for merchants and health partners—never selling personally identifiable data. Those insights help refine nutrition recommendations and fund fairer compensation for workers.

Good Grid’s mission is simple: build a smarter grid for food that is actually good—for your body, your neighborhood, and the people doing the work.
